# Digital Identity Management System Through Blockchain - Verifier 
The Digital Identity Management System (DIMS) is a blockchain based application aimed to provide secure method of storing and sharing digital credentials, certificates and degrees. It utitlizes decentralized networks to eliminate storage of important credentials on vulnerable servers that are prone to hijacking and hacking. The blockchain architecture makes sure that the credentials are tamper-proof by generating Non-fungible tokens of the credentials.

## Components
The DIMS architecture is made up of three main components:
<li> ISSUER </li>
<li> HOLDER </li>
<li> VERIFIER </li>

## DIMS Verifier
The verifier uses two methods of verifying credentials - Manual and Automatic. The manual method utilizes MD5 checksum whhereas the automatic method uses asymmetric cryptography.
